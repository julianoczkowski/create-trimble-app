# Modus Frontend Design Skill

Generates production-grade frontend interfaces using the **Modus 2.0 Design System** with Tailwind CSS. Enforces design system compliance for enterprise applications.

## What It Does

Automatically activates for frontend work in Modus-based projects. Creates production-ready, theme-compatible code with:

- Strict 9-color semantic system compliance
- Modus Web Components integration
- Modus Icons (700+ icons)
- Tailwind CSS with design system colors only
- Full light/dark theme compatibility (6 themes)

## Usage

```text
"Create a dashboard with a sidebar and data cards"
"Build a settings page with form inputs and toggles"
"Design a data table with filtering and pagination"
"Create a notification panel with status indicators"
```

Implements within Modus design system constraints, producing professional enterprise UI that works across all 6 themes.

## Design System Enforced

This skill prevents common violations:

- No generic Tailwind colors (blue-500, gray-300)
- No hardcoded hex/RGB values
- No external icon libraries
- No custom fonts
- Correct border utility usage
- Correct opacity utility syntax
- div-only HTML approach

## Framework Agnostic

Works with both React and Angular Modus boilerplates. The skill contains no framework-specific syntax - only design system rules that apply to both.

## Based On

Inspired by the [Frontend Design](../frontend/) skill, adapted for the Trimble Modus 2.0 Design System.
